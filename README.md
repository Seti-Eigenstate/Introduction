# Introduction

My name is **Richard Walters**, I recently graduated from Colorado Technical University and have earned my bachelors degree in Computer Science with a GPA of 3.51 graduating Cum Laude class of 2024. I am passionate about learning new technologies and problem solving and my hopes are to pursue a career in IT. I come from a background of construction work and other hard physical labor jobs that have taken a toll on my body, added to that I was involved in a head on vehicular accident in February of 2024 of which I sustained multiple injuries leaving me semi-disabled due to my right ankle being fused along with 5 other major surgeries I underwent. I have no prior expierience with tech jobs so getting my foot in the door somewhere will be challenging so any advice is welcomed. 

I am new to github and I am still learning the basics of version control, collaboration, and open source. I am excited to join this amazing community and contribute to some interesting projects. I am also looking for feedback and guidance from more experienced developers. 

### Interests

- **Software Development**: Crafting elegant solutions to real-world problems.
- **Algorithms and Data Structures**: Fascinated by the intricacies of efficient algorithms.
- **Open Source**: Contributing to projects that make a difference.

Some of the skills and tools that I am familiar with are:

- Python
- Java
- Linux
- HTML/CSS
- Visual Studio Code
- OOP
- Data science

I am always open to new opportunities and challenges.

# Introduction

My name is **Richard Walters**, and I am a **41-year-old** student at **Colorado Technical University**. I am studying **computer science** and I am passionate about learning new technologies and solving problems.

I am new to github and I am still learning the basics of version control, collaboration, and open source. I am excited to join this amazing community and contribute to some interesting projects. I am also looking for feedback and guidance from more experienced developers.

Some of the skills and tools that I am familiar with are:

- Python
- Java
- Linux
- HTML/CSS
- Visual Studio Code
- OOP
- Data science

You can find some of my projects and assignments on my github profile as soon as I complete them that is. Feel free to check them out and let me know what you think, I take contructive critism very well. If I am doing something stupid I am not aware of, please point it out and be respectful. I am going to make many mistakes but one mistake I will not make is laughing at others mistakes no matter how little or silly it may seem. I for one believe there is no such thing as a silly question and I hope that github is not like other social media platforms overrun with self righteous Katagelasticists who do nothing but scroll programming groups on fakebook Commenting with emoji's and lol's on posts written by individuals who are using these groups as intended. I hope this environment is more professional because I have had it with programming groups full of know it all's thinking they're better than everyone else smarter that everyone else. Honestly If you do these things I don't hate you, I think that you may have a serious mental disability and I don't think that is funny at all. I have multiple mental disorders and I struggle in many areas, empathy and respect is not one of them. People are going to be people and they're going to label what they see, but I will break your lable maker if you're hanging out with me. I'm smart enough to know that Einstien was not smarter than Tesla, and I am just as smart as Socrates who said. "I know one thing: that I know nothing." We truely are equals, even though it's hard to see for some, it's clear to me that all the knowlege that we as human beings have collected since the begining of mankind is likely to be around 10^-999999 of a perecent of all knowledge which is most likely not even close because knowledge in my opionion must be infinate and all that is known to be true is also subject to revision. Therefor we as humans are all equals in the since that we all have just 100 short years to live if we are lucky. I am here to learn and to help others anyway I can. “Opinion is really the lowest form of human knowledge. It requires no accountability, no understanding. The highest form of knowledge is empathy, for it requires us to suspend our egos and live in another’s world.” - Bill Bullard

I am always open to new opportunities and challenges. You can reach me at richardwalters@ctu.edu or connect with me on LinkedIn.
